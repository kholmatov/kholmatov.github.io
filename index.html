  <h3>Tell me about yourself?</h3>
  <div>
    <p>
    My name is Erkin. I am originally from Tajikistan which is located in Central Asia. I recently moved to the United States on a green card. 
<br>
I have been working in the software industry for the past 15 years.
<br>
I have started as a full-stack developer and now have mostly been 
doing backend for the past 8 years using Python and its frameworks. 
[such as FastAPI to create async (esink) API endpoints]
<br>
The most recent two companies I work‚Äôd for as a backend developer are called EPG Service based in Moscow, Russia and BartSoft based in Mississauga (misi-saga), Canada.
<br>
Before that, I also founded my own company, LazyDad which is a food delivery application based in Moscow, Russia. 
<br>
If you want more information, I can talk about what projects I worked on, in those companies. 

    </p>
  </div>
  <h3>What is your salary expectation?</h3>
  <div>
    <p>
  I am not thinking about salary yet but for me, the team (tim) and the project itself is more important. That‚Äôs why for now, I am mainly focusing on that. 
But I am a senior engineer with 15 years of experience so I expect (—ç–∫—Å-–ø–µ–∫—Ç) a salary that is in the range of standard market rate for senior level positions.
    </p>
  </div>
    <h3>What is your tech stack?</h3>
  <div>
    <p>
   <b>My backend tech stack is :</b> 
	<ul>
		<li>Python and its frameworks like FastAPI (—ç–π –ø–∏ –∞–π) and asyncIO (ey-sink –ê–ô–û),</li>
<li>for database, i‚Äôve used PostgreSql, and mySQL(si-kwel), Mongodb</li>  
<li>I‚Äôve also used (—é–∑–¥) AWS, Docker (doke:), Kubernetes (–∫—é–±–µ—Ä-–Ω–µ—Ç–∏:—Å), Elastic search, network load (–ª—É–≤–¥) balancers</li> 
<li>but I am always open to learning new technologies and it‚Äôs very easy for me to pick up new tech. In  my past projects, I quickly learned new technologies. For example, at EPG service, i used docker, and kubernetes and i learned them very quickly.</li> 
</ul>
    </p>
  </div>


    <h3>Epg-Service:</h3>
  <div>
    <p>
   At Epg service we offer an on-screen TV guide. It basically allows the viewer (–≤—é—ç—Ä) to navigate through different TV channels by content, title, date, time and using a remote controller. We did this by partnering (–ø–∞—Ä—Ç–Ω–µ—Ä–∏–Ω–≥) with more than 3000 (three thousand) channels and getting their TV program information and including them in our TV guide. 
</p>
<ul>
	<li>I worked as a lead backend developer there. Some of the work that i did for the company was that i</li>
<li>implemented scalable (—Å–∫–µ–π–ª–∞–±–ª) image resize feature for more than 50000 (fifty thousand) TV programs and 1 million users</li>
<li>also, i built a parser using asynchronous (—ç—Å–∏–Ω:–∫—Ä–∞–Ω–æ–∑) architecture(–∞—Ä–∫–∏:—Ç–µ–∫—á–∞) in Python</li>
<li>finally, i created a recommendation system for the TV programs</li>
</ul>	
    
  </div>


  <h3>Questions:</h3>
  <div>
    <ul>
    	<li>I had a question. How many steps is your interview process?</li>
		<li>Can you tell me more about the team that is hiring?</li>
		<li>How many engineers are in the company? How many teams are in the company?</li>
		<li>What kind of projects are they working on right now?</li>
    <li>How much time do I have to complete this challenge? (1 day)</li>
    <li>How much time do I really need to complete this challenge?</li>
    <li>How much time is normally needed to complete this challenge?</li>
	</ul>	
    </div>
  <h3>Summary:</h3>
  <div>
    <p>
    Thanks for your time. I am looking forward to hear back from you.

 <h3>Image resize project</h3>
<div>
<p>This project is helping to solve a problem with media content in a TV guide.</p>
<p>Our operators create illustrations in two formats vertical and horizontal in big size  for  tv events, then upload to our cloud storage.</p>
<p>Our goal is to make the image available for different platforms such as mobile/tablet/PC/TV.</p> 
<p>Delivering pictures of different sizes through our system to over a million users was not an easy task. So that the system works 24/7 without interruption and has the ability to auto-scaling.</p>    
<p>To solve this problem, my team and I organized a brainstorming session and came to the decision that we will use the following technologies:
<ul><li>Kubernetes - used to automate software deployment and to set up automatic scaling.</li>
<li>Docker - to create an image of our system</li>
<li>Network Load Balancer - automatically distributes your incoming traffic across multiple node</li> 
<li>S3 bucket - for caching processed images</li>
<li>Python with FastAPI web framework for developing API and pillow library for manipulation with images</li>
	</ul>
	</p>
</div>

<h3>Why our company?</h3>
<div>
I like that you care about the quality of life of people and the improvement of the situation in the industry.
<br/>You are simplifying the healthcare and benefits experience for every member.
<p>
I liked Healthjoy values:
<ul>
<li>ü§Ø  Open Mind</li>
<li>ü§ù  No Ego</li>
<li>üëç  Accountable</li>
<li>ü§©  Deliver JOY</li>
<li>ü§ó  Care</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
Finally, I have over 15 years of experience in the IT industry. I think my experience will help you develop high-level products in your company along with other developers.
<br/>When I read descriptions your Senior Software Engineer, Backend position, I saw many key technologies that I know and use in my solutions.
<br/>I have development experience on server platforms like Asyncio, Aiohttp, FastAPI, SQLAlchemy.
<br/>I understand microservice architecture and AWS ecosystem.

<h3>Who was your most difficult customer?</h3>
<div>
  When I worked as a web developer in Moscow. For one customer, due to not paying for hosting in a timely manner, the site was completely removed and it was impossible to restore it with the capabilities of the provider. After this incident, the customer was upset that all the information collected on the site was gone. Despite the day off, the customer called me on my skype and I immediately asked the customer to tell me what was going on. I quickly apologized for this mistake as the provider I chose was recommended by me. He was still frustrated and wanted to talk a little more about these issues because of his site, as the weight of his business depends on this site. I gave him all my attention, listened carefully and promised that I would resolve this issue and restore his site. Fortunately, I still have a backup of this client's website on my local computer. That day, I managed to restore the client's website and at the same time set up auto-backup on the provider's hosting. After the completed work, the customer was happy and rewarded me with a bonus payment.
</div>  


<h3>How do you go about prioritizing customer needs when you are dealing with a large number of customers?</h3>
<div>
  I believe in approaching each and every customer requirement with the same level of attention at first. Properly understanding the gap between importance and satisfaction is important when prioritizing each customer‚Äôs need. I would give priority for the important and expected features or demands first, and fulfill the requirements focusing satisfaction and delight after. It is all about recognizing the vital few from the trivial many.
</div>  

<h3>Tell me about a time when you took on a task that was beyond your job responsibilities.</h3>
<div>
According to the current work, my colleagues editors had the task of mastering all the requirements of our customer from the Moldtelecom company, where we needed to connect more than 100 channels. 
To improve our overall service, I had to study the weight of the material and help my colleagues understand their parts and added additional scripts for error checking, and to speed up our service, I suggested using machine translation to compose content in other languages.
After improving data processing in the company, we began to use this strategy for other customers too.
One of my principles is: The success of the company is my success.
</div>


<h3>Tell me about a time when you invented something</h3>
<div>
  Our company has an additional service is the creation of a poster in image format for TV programs. The peculiarity of this service is that we create a cross-platform poster in different sizes.
The algorithm works according to the following principle:
1. The designer creates a poster in two formats Horizontally and Vertically.
2. Next, the script crops the image to the desired size
This service is used by most of our clients and because of this, our server receives a large request. Sometimes during peak hours our server would hang and could not respond to the required requests.
Before me, the task was to improve this server so that the server was available 24/7.
I managed to successfully solve this problem using modern tools such as Docker, Kubernetes, Network Load Balancer, Cloud Storage. I also created a special asynchronous python script.
After my changes, this server began to process more requests without problems, and most importantly, this solution is easily scalable, which gives us the flexibility to serve more and more customers.
