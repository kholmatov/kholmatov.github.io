  <h3>Tell me about yourself?</h3>
  <div>
    <p>
    My name is Erkin. I am originally from Tajikistan which is located in Central Asia. I recently moved to the United States on a green card. 
<br>
I have been working in the software industry for the past 15 years.
<br>
I have started as a full-stack developer and now have mostly been 
doing backend for the past 8 years using Python and its frameworks. 
[such as FastAPI to create async (esink) API endpoints]
<br>
The most recent two companies I work’d for as a backend developer are called EPG Service based in Moscow, Russia and BartSoft based in Mississauga (misi-saga), Canada.
<br>
Before that, I also founded my own company, LazyDad which is a food delivery application based in Moscow, Russia. 
<br>
If you want more information, I can talk about what projects I worked on, in those companies.

  <h3>What is your salary expectation?</h3>
  <div>
    <p>
  I am not thinking about salary yet but for me, the team (tim) and the project itself is more important. That’s why for now, I am mainly focusing on that. 
But I am a senior engineer with 15 years of experience so I expect (экс-пект) a salary that is in the range of standard market rate for senior level positions.
    </p>
  </div>
    <h3>What is your tech stack?</h3>
  <div>
    <p>
   <b>My backend tech stack is :</b> 
	<ul>
		<li>Python and its frameworks like FastAPI (эй пи ай) and asyncIO (ey-sink АЙО),</li>
<li>for database, i’ve used PostgreSql, and mySQL(si-kwel), Mongodb</li>  
<li>I’ve also used (юзд) AWS, Docker (doke:), Kubernetes (кюбер-нети:с), Elastic search, network load (лувд) balancers</li> 
<li>but I am always open to learning new technologies and it’s very easy for me to pick up new tech. In  my past projects, I quickly learned new technologies. For example, at EPG service, i used docker, and kubernetes and i learned them very quickly.</li> 
</ul>
    </p>

    <h3>Epg-Service:</h3>
  <div>
    <p>
   At Epg service we offer an on-screen TV guide. It basically allows the viewer (вюэр) to navigate through different TV channels by content, title, date, time and using a remote controller. We did this by partnering (партнеринг) with more than 3000 (three thousand) channels and getting their TV program information and including them in our TV guide. 
</p>
<ul>
	<li>I worked as a lead backend developer there. Some of the work that i did for the company was that i</li>
<li>implemented scalable (скейлабл) image resize feature for more than 50000 (fifty thousand) TV programs and 1 million users</li>
<li>also, i built a parser using asynchronous (эсин:краноз) architecture(арки:текча) in Python</li>
<li>finally, i created a recommendation system for the TV programs</li>
</ul>	
    
  </div>


  <h3>Questions:</h3>
  <div>
    <ul>
    	<li>I had a question. How many steps is your interview process?</li>
		<li>Can you tell me more about the team that is hiring?</li>
		<li>How many engineers are in the company? How many teams are in the company?</li>
		<li>What kind of projects are they working on right now?</li>
    <li>How much time do I have to complete this challenge? (1 day)</li>
    <li>How much time do I really need to complete this challenge?</li>
    <li>How much time is normally needed to complete this challenge?</li>
	</ul>

  <h3>Summary:</h3>
  <div>
    <p>
    Thanks for your time. I am looking forward to hear back from you.

 <h3>Image resize project</h3>
<div>
<p>This project is helping to solve a problem with media content in a TV guide.</p>
<p>Our operators create illustrations in two formats vertical and horizontal in big size  for  tv events, then upload to our cloud storage.</p>
<p>Our goal is to make the image available for different platforms such as mobile/tablet/PC/TV.</p> 
<p>Delivering pictures of different sizes through our system to over a million users was not an easy task. So that the system works 24/7 without interruption and has the ability to auto-scaling.</p>    
<p>To solve this problem, my team and I organized a brainstorming session and came to the decision that we will use the following technologies:
<ul><li>Kubernetes - used to automate software deployment and to set up automatic scaling.</li>
<li>Docker - to create an image of our system</li>
<li>Network Load Balancer - automatically distributes your incoming traffic across multiple node</li> 
<li>S3 bucket - for caching processed images</li>
<li>Python with FastAPI web framework for developing API and pillow library for manipulation with images</li>
	</ul>
	</p>
